# Futhark

Futhark aims to be an app for learning the runic alphabet.

Currently, the app is only a skeleton but it already implements an interesting feature: a keyboard that allows you to write in runic characters. The keyboard has been implemented in SwiftUI and it is possible to set it as the system keyboard for the iPhone.
